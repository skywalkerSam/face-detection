# [Face Detection](https://github.com/skywalkerSam/face-detection)

A simple `face-detection` application using `clarifai`. This project is made with `create-react-app`, and deployed on `github-pages`, and it works. [Here...](https://skywalkersam.github.io/face-detection/)



```shell
npm init vite@latest
```
```shell
npm i
```
```shell
vite
```
```shell
vite build
```


- Using `render` for backend deployment




`NOTE`: Standalone frontend won't work, API calls moved to the backend for security reasons

## Until next time...
